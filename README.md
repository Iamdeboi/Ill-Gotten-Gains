# "Ill Gotten Gains"
The following repo belongs to my personal game project using the Godot engine in versions 4.x. This is a strictly solo-developed game made using my current knowledge of Godot's engine basics and with the guidance and project framework of the wonderful youtube tutorial series made by guldam (GodotGameLab).

# Project Description
This game can be described as a rougelike with turn-based RPG combat game and deckbuilding elements (though not necessarily a card game!), with inspiration deriving from 
titles such as  Mega Crit's "Slay the Spire" and Klei Entertainment's "Griftlands" as a couple of examples. 

This project's main mechanics include:  
* Character Class Selection in new Runs
* Randomized Map Generation
* Multiple Room Types: Campfire, Treasure, Shop, Monster(Battles), Boss Room
* Randomized Enemy Encounters and Reward Pools
* Player and Enemy Stat system including attributes for scaling with attacks and actions
* Ability System which scales to the user's statblock
* Effect System to allow different effects to occur upon the use of an ability, an enemy using its actions, etc.
* Modifier System to influence damage dealt, recieved, ability costs, and statblock attributes midcombat
* Treasure System to add new effects under specified conditionals both inside and outside of combat

Features still being planned/worked on include: (Updated as of 7/21/2025)
* More features such a Dialouge System and Event Rooms
* More maps/levels for more enemy variety and combat mechanics
* Greed System, (the game's X-factor mechanic) that weighs the players risk/reward in the many interactions of the game.
* Quests/Achievement System to unlock new Treasures, new maps and playable Classes for subsequent playthroughs of the game

As my first portfolio project, I have ultlized the development of this game to further research and learn the Godot engine and programming fundamental concepts that allow for the creation of new mechanics, as well as ultilzing version control for personal projects such as this.
This game will be free to play on itch.io once it is in a feature complete state after rounds of playtesting.
